        <p>This club was created during the spring of 2016, and has been going strong since. We have grown considerably, and have created teams for each of our members projects. We have a website team, that maintains the website. We also have a security team, that is going to be all cyber security. Our last team is our game development, which are working on a game on the Love2D engine.</p>
